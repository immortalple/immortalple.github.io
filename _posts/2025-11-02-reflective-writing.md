---A
Before this module, I often used technology, but I did not understand the TPACK model. My knowledge was mostly just about the tool. Now I understand that technology must connect deeply with the content and the teaching method. This focus on TPACK was the biggest new knowledge I gained. I learned that a good digital tool must help people learn the specific subject matter through an effective way. This experience greatly improved my lifelong learning skills, especially self-direction and adaptability. For example, I used Canva to create visual summaries for refugee school students. I researched time management strategies and implemented the ADDIE Model's revision stage by simplifying the design requirements. This quick change influenced me a lot. Using Signal Call , I arranged short video calls with students from different school to discuss climate issues. I had to learn how to do presentation securely and to solve technical issues. I learned that I must be ready to learn new methods and tools constantly to improve my skills.

The planned of digital tools changed my role completely. I moved from being the main person receiving information to being a facilitator. This change gave me a lot more confidence and made me better at solving problems. I used Signal Call for cross-cultural exchange. Signal's secure nature allowed us to have genuine, open conversations about actual daily lives and sensitive political issues. This immediate, secure connection broke down geopolitical barriers. I became a global connector. This technology also helped empathy. I used Padlet where we can anonymously posted opinions on complex social topics. This written format allowed shy people to express deep feelings without the pressure of speaking in person. We all learned to read and respond to different views carefully, which improved positive interaction and empathy. The technology created a safer space for dialogue.

Using these digital tools provided great benefits, especially by making learning student-centered and boosting positive social interaction.

Using Canva allowed people, especially non-native-speaker like refugee school student, to show their learning in a creative, visual way, instead of just writing essays. This process helped develop their 21st-century digital literacy skills and improved their memory of the content. people learned to use design principles to present arguments effectively. The Padlet activity required people to reflect on complex issues and then comment constructively on others' posts. This structured environment helped them practice digital etiquette and learn to disagree respectfully. Padlet was a critical tool for building empathy because people were exposed to and had to acknowledge viewpoints different from their own, leading to more positive peer interaction.

Strengths - The main advantage was the strong TPACK alignment. Each tool served a unique teaching goal that deepened content understanding and built soft skills (creativity, communication). The tools made learning more equal by giving quiet students a voice.

Challenges - The primary challenge was Equity and Access. The Digital Divide meant students without reliable internet or good electronic device, especially with Padlet AI-Driven features like image generation or High-Resolution video calls on Signal, struggled to have positive experience. This created unfairness. Second, time management was always an issue. I spent too much class time teaching refugee students how to use Canva features, which reduced time for the main subject. This constant balance is difficult. Finally, I chose Signal for its encryption, but the initial setup required careful technical setting to ensure the safety. Overcoming these hurdles requires better training and institutional support for technology from NGO and open-source community.
